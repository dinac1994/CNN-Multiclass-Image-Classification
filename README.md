# Image-Classification-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Image Classification using neural networks with and without convolutional layers. This code shows the benefits of using convolutional neural networks in image classification.

Each image is classified as "rock", "paper" or "scissors", depending on the shape the hand takes.

Final best result: ~81% accuracy.
